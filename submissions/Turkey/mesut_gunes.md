## üáπüá∑ Your Observations

```yaml
What is the characteristic of your country in terms of testing culture?:
- Turkey: There is still a trend toward agile development. Regardless of the methodology, software development is heavily influenced by culture‚Äîe.g., quickly implementing a feature to meet a new regulation, or redirecting current work to tackle a CEO-initiated feature. This makes testers become 'agile' and ready for whatever coming next.
 - Generally teams are very young and dynamic
 - Development / testing processes are not mature enough
 - People are very eager to learn new testing tools and technologies also they do not hesitate to integrate them. I assume this is a result of culturel approach that is quick start and quick failure instead of doing wisely analysis or investigation.
 - There is a considerable hierarchy but people don't hesitate to go to the upper level manager

- The USA: 
    - Coorporate Project: Development process also the testing process are depends on some of the best practices and the changes are slow. There is a powerful hierarchy. Managers and directors have well defined role definitions. 
        - Very professional team members. 
        - Slow but security focused test plans
        - Awareness in changes is high, and there is a tradition to present new features / tasks to all team. 
    - Start-up Project: In US the start-up, everything are shaped based on the speed. The culture in these companies has always time pressure to deliver new product. Agile has a room to in the development process. Testing can be very tricky, QE team are mostly alligned with development team to create correct product from the beginning. Automation has a critical role to speed-up the testing process and not to reduce overall delivery speed. 
        - Fast delivery based testing process
        - Developers and testers work closely
        - No isolation for any work you do

How is testing practiced differently in your country?:
- Turkey: It is not so different, companies, in general, follow the global best practices. However, I observed this in many projects, upper managers are not capable of managing teams with best practices. This can result in having new version of process-like agilish-waterfall 

Is there anything you were surprised to see anywhere in term of testing?:
- Instead of having hundreds of e2e tests that included flakiness, we reduced them to cover only major business to only three real e2e tests.

What are the biggests strengths and weaknesses of your country?:
- Turkey:
    - Strength:
        - I've observed that there has been a great deal of learning new tool and technologies
        - Automation has very important role
        - Very energetic team members
        - Team members are accustomed to crises so even major problems can be solved quickly
    - Weakness: 
        - I see that the knowledge behind being a good tester might be overlooked 
        - Success of the automation projects are not good enough.
        - There is a need for experienced automation engineers
        - Team work should be more effective, people tend to work in isolation
